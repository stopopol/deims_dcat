    ns2:description "The Zöbelboden was established in 1992 as the only Integrated Monitoring station in Austria under the UN Convention on long-range transboundary air pollution (CLRTAP). In 2006 it became part of LTER Austria. The Zöbelboden covers a small forested catchment (90 ha) of a karstic mountain range (500 to 950 m above sea level) in the Kalkalpen National Park. Monitoring and research is focussing on climate change effects on forest ecosystems, the forest carbon and nitrogen cycle, biodiversity, and air pollution effects on forested catchments. The Zöbelboden represents one of the best known karst catchments in Europe with long-term data series of the major components of its ecosystems. The site is part of many national and international monitoring and research networkds (ICP Integrated Monitoring, EMEP, LTER, forestREplot, SoilTemp, LifePlan, IG-L, EU NEC-D, etc.). The Zöbelboden is managed by the Environement Agency Austria with technical support of the Kalkalpen National Park and the Austrian Federal Forests." ;
